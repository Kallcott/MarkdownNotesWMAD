MVC
	- Model: represents data models. Think data flow in Visual paradigm. 

Scaffolding: structure that supports files behind the scenes. 
- Window's device drivers that are availble as default is a scaffold for using generic devices.

Input parameters in the url using same format as an SQL query string.
- /?name=Judson
- seperate multiple with & : ?name=Judson&age=30

Views with razor:
- supports dynamic views inside the file. 
- Razer comments:  @* *@
- views/shared/\_layout  is where the body of the HTML is store including the footer, header, & navigation
- we can modify the layout view by view within the @{ } area of razor
- Our Razor pages are injected into the layout at the @RenderBody() method.
