## PP: ASP.NET - MVC Intro
MVC design pattern to seperate concerns by assigning specific roles to three different components. 

Advantages of Web Forms (not ideal modern)

Advantages of MVC web apps
- Manage complex apps
- Not to use view state or server based forms. 
- It uses a front controller pattern to process requests. Best for rich routing infrastructure
- Better support for test driven development

## Coding
Don't use CORE project types, or Visual Basic project types
- Default folders: Controller, Models, View
	- Controller: we use MV5 type controller
		- Naming: the last phrase of a controller should be "Controller"
		- Controllers are classes


When launching the application it will open in web browswer
- A port will be generated for this server
- IF HTTPS is used it will generate a certificate. 
- There it will start at the root directory
- Manual Calls: 
	- Call Conrtoller Class: "/Name" after the port. We don't put the Full name "NameController" 
	- Call Method: "/Name/NameMethod"
