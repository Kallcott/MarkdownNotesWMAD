## Terminology
**Analysis**: the WHAT; description of problems and requirements. 

**Design** : the HOW; to fufill requirements and constraints (logical solution).

**Object oriented analysis & design**: find and describe objects in the problem domain (analysis), then define what logical software objects will be needed (design). 
-Code implementation (coding) - Testing - Deployment/Instalation. 
-Usualy Iterative

**Iterative**: repeated phases that are cycliear. It breaks down the project into peices. 

**Iterative Development** - Gathering requirements, - analysis and design, - implementation, - testing. Will all result in a sebset of the final project. 

**Functional requirements**: Interactions between actor and application. What should the system output to users?

**Non-functional requirements**: Performance, extensibility, and maintainability. How fast? How scalable? 

**Primary Stakeholder**: directly involved. Employees -> Customers

**Secondary Stakeholders**: effected by outcomes or actions of. Suppliers -> Services Used

**Internal Stakeholder**: Inside the business: Owners, 

**External Stakeholder**: Outside the business: Customers, government

**Coarse Grain**:  High level / broad strokes with not much detail. 

**Fine Grain:** Low level / every small feature detailed.

**Iteration Methodologies:**
- Unified Process
- Agile Software development
- SCRUM
- Extreme Programming
- Disciplined Agile Delivery. 
**Waterfall Approach (SDLC)** approach of doing each phase for the entire project at one time, then moving onto the next. Fails with todays sophisticated software systems. 

#### **Rational Unified Process** 
refinement of unified process and is an **iterative** apprach to address the highest risk items at every stage in the lifecycle. Focuses on managing the requirements of the project and developing component-based solutions. 

 #### -Inception - Elaboration - Construction - Transition 
**Inception**: Specifying the end product vision and it's business case, scope, vague estimates. 
- To decide if project should proceed, and commit resources to it. 
**Elaboration**: refined vision, plan for coding, resolving risks, extensive requirements & scope, discover all use cases, more realistic estimates. 
- To stabalize architecture and plan high risk use cases. 
**Construction**: Usually many iterations. Each one builds a subset of the requirements. The order of the iteration starts with the highest risk. 
- To complete development
**Transition**: beta tetsing, delivering, deploying, training, maintaining. 
- To deploy the product

Time for each phase: 1 week small projects, 2 weeks for medium. based on number of iterations. - Elaboration, construction will take bulk of iterations. 

##### Best Practices:
1. undefineddevelop iteratively and incrementally

2. manage requirements

3. component based architecture: each component fufills a clear cuntcion

4. visually model software before implementing

5. verify quality

6. control changes to software: track changes, security in changes, 

## Interviews
- **Determine who to interview** : Stakeholders, 
- **Establish objectives**: 
Lists the facts you want to gather, form question on their basis. 
- **Develop Interview questions**
-You can depart from this list during the interview as new information is found + follow up.
-Start with general questions then proceed to more narrow questions. 
-Don't lead the interviewee, 
- **Prepare for the interview** 
When possible, shecudle specific day and time. Give a reminder, and confirm meeting. Location: Their home turf (better acess to documets) , or a neutral location (away from distractions). 
- **Conduct interview**
ask questions in order of the highest risk, give them enough time to answer. 
Establish a good rapport, 
Practice engaged listening: note body language and tone.
- **Document interview**
Take notes, but stay focused, you flesh them out after the interview. 
Ask before using recording devices. Even if they say yes, opt not to if uncomfortable. 
- **Evaluate interview**
Record facts, and identify biases
- People may have strong opinions, or be hesitant to protect their position, or be helpful without necessary experience. 
**Interview vs. Questionnaires:**
Questionnaire: When you must ask a series of questions to many individuals
Interview: information from only a few people. 

## Requirement Workshops: 
a collabrative event for carefully selected stakeholders worked by the dev team. Lasts half a day. Includes: 
- Gaining stakeholder consensus: 
Problem statement, project scope, main functional requirements, setting proorities, risk evaluation. 
- speed up requirement gathering
- foster working relationships
- make milestones for iterations. 

**Brainstorming**: No bad ideas, write everything, 
-dev team explains technical implications, 
-stakeholders explain business process. 

## Inception Phase
 SCOPE: Project feasibility and risk analysis, with following objectives
- Identify business needs 
- Establish **vision document**
- Develop business case and stakeholder analysis
- Develop preliminary/rough schedules & cost estimates

#### Deliverable: Vision Document
Purpose is a clear understanding of the strategic direction of the organization. 
It will be a written problem statement that all agree to. 
Use a glossary for acronyms, abbreviations, and project specific term/ideas that require explanation.

Contents:
- **High level requirements** – prioritized
- Scope (what is **in/out** of scope)
- **Initial risk list** – possible problems and the plan to deal with them
- **Initial Glossary** – collection of keywords from business and from dev team
- **Initial business rules catalog** – True/False constraint statement to describe business operation and culture.
- **proof of concept** - (minimum viable product)
- **Problem statement** and objectives/goals
- **Stakeholders Analysis** (those impacted by the system)
- **Use Case** Names prioritized / **Skeleton** Use Cases 

#### Problem Statement:
**The Problem of:** What
**Affects:** Who
**The impact of which is:** bad outcomes
**A successful solution would:** features

#### Stakeholder Analysis
Identifying all of the stakeholders.
- Determining each one’s interest level.
- What Information does each needed during the project?
- What Information should each be provided back?

##### Use Cases Naming Rules
Describing the functionality of the system. How an actor uses it, motivations behind them. 
- Cannot be more than 3 words, less is better
- First must be an action word.

## Project Planning
##### Sub deliverable: Phase Plan
High level, coarse grain view of the project. 
Shows number of iterations with start & end dates, and dates for deliverables/milestones for each iteration. - Staffing estimates

##### Sub deliverable: Iteration Plan
a detailed look at the upcoming iteration: minute tasks and details. 
all the tasks required, large tasks decomposed into sub stasks, 
-last task is alwasy development of next iteration plan.
